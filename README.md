# I want to build the environment

### 1. Set up your environment

Sure. Few steps to make the magic happen: 

- First, install node and npm (depends on your OS)

For Mac users, ```brew``` will make it: 
```bash
brew install node
```

- Then, install ```npm```:

```bash
brew install npm
```

Finally, install ```ionic```: 

```bash
npm install -g ionic
```
### 2. Clone the repo

- Clone the repo using Git: 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/whid-injector/WHID-Mobile-Connector/
```

- Go in the folder

```bash
cd WHID-Mobile-Connector
```

- Add Android platform to the project

```bash
ionic cordova platform add android
```

### 3. Build it

Then, you're ready to build a resulting APK that can be deployed wherever you want. 

```bash
ionic cordova build android
```

If everything goes well, APK should be at:
```bash
/path/to/my/folder/platforms/android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

# Build using Docker

Go to the docker folder

```bash
cd WHID-Mobile-Connector/docker
```

Build and tag the image

```bash
docker build -t kbeflo/whid-mobile-connector-build:0.0.5 .
```

Start building WHID Mobile Connector using the image we've just built

```bash
docker run -it -v "$PWD"/..:/WHID-Mobile-Connector kbeflo/whid-mobile-connector-build:0.0.5 ionic cordova build android
```

You're now done! You can find the apk at
